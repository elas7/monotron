Reverse engineering of the Monotron. Made with Web Audio API, React and Redux.

Demo: https://elas7.github.io/monotron/

You can play it with a QWERTY keyboard or with a mouse. It also works on mobile (with multi-touch support). This means that you can play a note and move the knobs at the same time, in any platform.
